Time Complexity:

Add: O(1) 
Search: O(n)
Traverse: O(n)
Delete: O(n) for finding the element and shifting elements to fill the gap.

Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size which cannot be changed after creation.
Insertion/Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements requires shifting elements, which can be inefficient.
Memory Usage: Arrays may waste memory if not fully utilized or require resizing if the capacity is exceeded.
When to Use Arrays:

Use arrays when we have a fixed number of elements and need fast access to elements by index.
