Time Complexity:

Linear Search: O(n) for both best and worst cases.
Binary Search: O(log n) for both best and worst cases

Binary Search is more suitable for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity. However, it requires the array to be sorted.

Linear Search is simpler and works with unsorted data but is less efficient for large datasets.
