1. Time complexity -

Add Product: O(1) average time complexity, as HashMap allows constant time insertion.

Update Product: O(1) average time complexity, similar to the add operation.

Delete Product: O(1) average time complexity, as deletion by key is also a constant time operation in HashMap

2. Further optimization-
Using custom hash function to avoid any collision
